Make DuckDuckGo look like Google.

**Why?**

Switching search engines can be a struggle. Making it look like something familiar can help.

**How to use:**

I am using Stylish. A chrome extension that allows for CSS rules to be applied over a website. Check it out [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en)

**Recommendation**
Switch to the basic theme to allow a more Google-like style. Without some DOM editing, it can be difficult to get a closer styling.
